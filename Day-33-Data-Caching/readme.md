# 🗓️ Day 33: Network Optimization (Client-Side Caching)

## 🎯 Problem Statement
Making a network request is one of the most expensive operations in web development. It takes time, consumes battery, and eats into API rate limits. If a user searches for a profile, closes it, and then searches for it again 10 seconds later, fetching the exact same data from the server is inefficient. Today, we build a **Data Cache**. We will intercept API requests, check if we already have the data in local memory, and serve it instantly if we do.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Focus Areas
* **Languages:** Vanilla JavaScript (ES6)
* **Core Concepts:** The `Map` Object, In-Memory Storage, Memoization, Network Interception.
* **Goal:** Engineer a memory layer inside the API module that drastically reduces redundant HTTP requests.

## 📝 Task Requirements
1. **The Memory Bank:** Open your `api.js` module from yesterday. At the very top of the file (outside of any functions), create a new cache using the ES6 Map object: `const userCache = new Map();`. 
2. **The Intercept Logic:** Inside your `fetchUserData(username)` function, before you do *anything* else, check the cache. Write an `if` statement: `if (userCache.has(username)) { ... }`.
3. **The Instant Return:** If the cache *does* have the username, return the saved data immediately: `return userCache.get(username);`. Add a `console.log("Serving from cache!")` so you can visually verify it's working without looking at the network tab.
4. **The Save Logic:** If the data is not in the cache, the function proceeds to the `fetch()` call. Once the server responds and you parse the data (`await response.json()`), save it to your map before returning it: `userCache.set(username, data);`.
5. **Test the Engine:** Open your app. Search for a username. It will take a second to load. Now, search for a different username. Finally, search for the *first* username again. It should load instantly, and your console should confirm the cache was used!

## 🚀 Bonus Challenge (Optional)
Data goes stale. If a user leaves their tab open for 3 hours, their cached data might be out of date. Upgrade your cache to include a **Time-To-Live (TTL)**. Instead of just saving the data, save an object that includes the data AND a timestamp (`{ data: responseData, timestamp: Date.now() }`). When checking the cache, verify if the timestamp is older than 5 minutes. If it is, delete it and fetch fresh data!

## ⚠️ Common Pitfalls & Expected Bugs
* **Caching Errors:** If an API request fails (e.g., a `404 Not Found`), do NOT save that error to the cache! Ensure your `userCache.set()` logic only runs if the response is fully successful.
* **Map vs. Object:** While you can use a standard `{}` object for caching, the ES6 `Map` is specifically optimized for frequent additions and removals, and it safely handles weird string keys that might break standard objects.

## 🧠 Outcomes & Learnings
* Internalized the concept of Memoization and Data Caching.
* Eliminated redundant network payloads, speeding up the UI significantly.
* Understood how module scope protects global variables (like the cache) from being accessed or corrupted by other files.
