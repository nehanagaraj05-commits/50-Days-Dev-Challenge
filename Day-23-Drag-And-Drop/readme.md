# 🗓️ Day 23: The HTML5 Drag and Drop API (Kanban Board)

## 🎯 Problem Statement
On Day 20, we built a functional Task Tracker. However, modern engineering teams manage projects using Kanban boards (like Trello, Asana, or Jira) where tasks are visually moved through different stages of completion. Today, we are upgrading our platform. By utilizing the native HTML5 Drag and Drop API, we will empower users to physically grab their tasks and drag them between "To Do", "In Progress", and "Done" columns.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Focus Areas
* **Languages:** Vanilla JavaScript, HTML5
* **Core Concepts:** The `draggable` attribute, `dragstart` & `dragend` events, `dragover` & `drop` events, Spatial DOM Appendage.
* **Goal:** Engineer a tactile, interactive user interface utilizing advanced native browser event listeners.

## 📝 Task Requirements
1. **The HTML Layout:** Open `index.html`. Using the provided snippet, create three distinct columns: "To Do", "In Progress", and "Done". Create a few sample task cards inside the "To Do" column and give them the attribute `draggable="true"`.
2. **The Drag State (JS):** Open `script.js`. Select all your `.task-card` elements and add event listeners for `dragstart` and `dragend`.
   * On `dragstart`, add a CSS class called `.is-dragging` to the card so we know which one is currently being held. (Tip: slightly lower its opacity via CSS so it looks like it's floating).
   * On `dragend`, remove the `.is-dragging` class.
3. **The Drop Zones:** Select all your `.column` elements. We need to tell the browser that these columns are valid places to drop items.
4. **The `dragover` Intercept:** Attach a `dragover` event listener to each column. **Crucial step:** You MUST call `e.preventDefault()` inside this listener. By default, browsers refuse to let elements drop into other elements. Preventing that default behavior unlocks the drop zone.
5. **The `drop` Execution:** Still inside the `dragover` (or a separate `drop` listener), find the element currently holding the `.is-dragging` class and use `column.appendChild(draggedElement)` to snap it into the new column!

## 🚀 Bonus Challenge (Optional)
Make the UX flawless! Right now, an appended task just drops to the very bottom of the column. Research how to calculate the mouse's Y-position during the `dragover` event so you can insert the dragged task *between* specific items rather than just throwing it at the bottom. 

## ⚠️ Common Pitfalls & Expected Bugs
* **The "No Drop" Cursor:** If you try to drag a card and your cursor turns into a red circle with a slash, you forgot to call `e.preventDefault()` in your `dragover` event. 
* **Querying Too Early:** If you dynamically create tasks using JS (like we did on Day 20) but your `querySelectorAll('.task-card')` runs *before* they are rendered, your drag events won't attach. Use event delegation or attach the drag listeners during the creation loop!

## 🧠 Outcomes & Learnings
* Unlocked tactile User Experience (UX) patterns without using heavy external drag-and-drop libraries.
* Mastered the relationship between the mouse cursor, DOM nodes, and the HTML5 Drag API.
* Elevated a basic list into a professional project management tool architecture.

> It's easy to assume you need React or complex libraries to build Trello-like interfaces, but the native HTML5 Drag and Drop API is incredibly powerful. By managing `dragstart`, intercepting `dragover` defaults, and manipulating DOM appendage, I engineered a fluid board where tasks can be physically moved through pipeline stages.
