# 🗓️ Day 32: Architecture & Code Splitting (ES6 Modules)

## 🎯 Problem Statement
As our application grows, our JavaScript file has become a massive, scrolling wall of text. Mixing UI logic, API calls, and utility functions in one place causes variable collisions and makes collaboration impossible. Today, we adopt a modular architecture. We will split our code into distinct files (`utils.js`, `api.js`, `main.js`) and use native ES6 Modules to share logic between them, keeping our engine clean, scalable, and professional.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Focus Areas
* **Languages:** Vanilla JavaScript (ES6)
* **Core Concepts:** Native Browser Modules, `import` / `export` syntax, Separation of Concerns, Scope Isolation.
* **Goal:** Refactor a monolithic script into a structured, multi-file architecture using native web standards.

## 📝 Task Requirements
1. **Enable Modules:** Open `index.html`. Update your script tag to include the module type: `<script type="module" src="main.js"></script>`. This unlocks the `import` and `export` keywords in the browser.
2. **The Utilities Module:** Create a new file called `utils.js`. Move your `debounce` function (from Day 28) into this file. Add the `export` keyword directly in front of the function declaration.
3. **The API Module:** Create a new file called `api.js`. Move your CRUD fetch functions (like `fetchContributor` or `updateInitiative`) here. Export them.
4. **The Main Engine:** Create `main.js`. At the very top of the file, use the `import` keyword to pull in your functions from the other files: `import { debounce } from './utils.js';`.
5. **Re-bind the Events:** Inside `main.js`, select your DOM elements and attach your event listeners, utilizing the imported functions exactly as you did before.

## 🚀 Bonus Challenge (Optional)
Look into `export default`. If a file only exports one primary thing (like a major `Router` class or a single `initializeApp` function), you can use a default export. Try refactoring one of your modules to use a default export and update the import syntax in `main.js` to match!

## ⚠️ Common Pitfalls & Expected Bugs
* **The CORS Error (CORS Policy):** If you try to open your `index.html` file directly by double-clicking it in your file explorer (`file://...`), modules will fail to load, and your console will show a CORS error. Native modules require a local server. You MUST use an extension like VS Code Live Server to test this!
* **Forgetting the `.js` Extension:** In Node.js or React, you can write `import { debounce } from './utils'`. In the native browser environment, you *must* include the file extension: `import { debounce } from './utils.js'`.

## 🧠 Outcomes & Learnings
* Mastered the "Separation of Concerns" design principle.
* Engineered a scalable file architecture using standard web protocols.
* Understood how module scoping protects variables from leaking into the global `window` object.

> Today was all about Software Architecture and Code Splitting. 🧱
>
> Writing 500 lines of code in a single file is a beginner's trap. As the platform's logic grew with APIs and dynamic feeds, I needed to refactor the monolith. Without relying on heavy bundlers like Webpack, I implemented native ES6 Modules directly in the browser.
>
> By utilizing `import` and `export` protocols, I separated the network logic (`api.js`), performance tools (`utils.js`), and UI bindings (`main.js`) into isolated, maintainable environments. Clean architecture scales.
