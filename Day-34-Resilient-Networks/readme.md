# 🗓️ Day 34: Network Resilience (Retries & Exponential Backoff)

## 🎯 Problem Statement
A simple `try/catch` block handles errors gracefully, but it gives up immediately. If a user is on a mobile device and their connection drops for a millisecond, our app currently throws a complete failure state. Modern, resilient platforms don't give up on the first failure. They silently try again. Today, we are engineering an automatic retry system with "Exponential Backoff," ensuring our platform fights to get the data before showing the user an error.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Focus Areas
* **Languages:** Vanilla JavaScript (ES8+)
* **Core Concepts:** `for` Loops in Async functions, `Promise` Delays, Exponential Math, Network Reliability.
* **Goal:** Engineer a wrapper function that automatically retries failed network requests with increasing time delays.

## 📝 Task Requirements
1. **The Retry Utility:** Open `utils.js`. Create and export a new async function: `export async function fetchWithRetry(url, options = {}, retries = 3, backoff = 500)`.
2. **The Loop:** Inside this function, create a `for` loop that runs based on the `retries` parameter (e.g., `for (let i = 0; i < retries; i++)`).
3. **The Attempt:** Move your `fetch()` call inside a `try` block within this loop. If the response is `ok`, `return response;` immediately (this breaks the loop and succeeds!).
4. **The Catch & Delay:** If the fetch fails, catch the error. 
   * Check if we are on the *last* retry (`if (i === retries - 1)`). If we are, `throw error;` to finally give up.
   * If it's not the last try, we need to wait. Create a delay using a Promise: `await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, backoff));`.
5. **The Exponential Math:** Multiply the `backoff` variable by 2 at the end of the loop (`backoff *= 2;`). This means it will wait 500ms on the first fail, 1000ms on the second, and 2000ms on the third. This gives the server (or the user's cell tower) time to recover!
6. **Implement the Wrapper:** Open `api.js`. Import your new `fetchWithRetry` utility. Replace your standard `fetch(url)` calls with `fetchWithRetry(url)`.

## 🚀 Bonus Challenge (Optional)
Look into the `navigator.onLine` browser API. Before you even attempt the first fetch, write an `if` statement checking if the user is completely offline. If `navigator.onLine` is false, throw a custom error immediately ("No internet connection detected") so you don't waste time trying to fetch data without Wi-Fi!

## ⚠️ Common Pitfalls & Expected Bugs
* **Retrying 404s:** You should generally only retry network failures or `500 Internal Server Errors`. If the server responds with a `404 Not Found` or `403 Forbidden`, retrying won't help (the data is still gone or blocked). Add an `if` statement to throw an error immediately for client-side (400-level) errors.
* **Missing the Return:** Make sure `fetchWithRetry` returns the raw `response` object so that your `api.js` file can still call `.json()` on it!

## 🧠 Outcomes & Learnings
* Engineered enterprise-grade network resilience.
* Mastered the concept of Exponential Backoff to prevent spamming failing servers.
* Leveraged Promises to create synchronous-style delays in asynchronous loops.

>
> Dropped mobile connections shouldn't result in immediate failure screens. I built a custom `fetchWithRetry` utility using Vanilla JavaScript. Instead of giving up when a network request fails, the engine now automatically retries the call. 
>
> More importantly, I implemented an "Exponential Backoff" algorithm using Promises. If it fails once, it waits 500ms. If it fails again, it waits 1 second. This gives the connection time to stabilize without spamming the server. Standard engineering handles the unhappy path gracefully.
