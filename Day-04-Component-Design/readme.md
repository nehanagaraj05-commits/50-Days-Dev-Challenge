# 🗓️ Day 04: Component Design & UI Hierarchy (Core Team Cards)

## 🎯 Problem Statement
A great technical platform is built on modularity. If you look at top tech sites, elements like product displays or team member profiles are not written as unique, custom pieces of code each time. Instead, they use standardized **UI Components**. Today, we are designing a reusable "Profile Card" component for our leadership team, focusing on structural boundaries, padding, and visual balance.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Focus Areas
* **Languages:** HTML5, CSS3
* **Core Concepts:** Component-Driven Design, Visual Hierarchy, Border-Radius, Overflow Control, Typography Weights.
* **Goal:** Create a single, self-contained CSS card structure that looks identical no matter how many times it is duplicated with different content.

## 📝 Task Requirements
1. **Update the HTML Structure:** Go to your Core Team section in `index.html`. Inside it, create a container element (e.g., `<div class="team-grid">`). Inside that container, build a single profile card component using a descriptive class name like `<div class="profile-card">`.
2. **Add Component Data:** Inside each `.profile-card`, add:
   * A placeholder image (or use a free service like `via.placeholder.com/150`).
   * An `<h3>` tag for the member's name.
   * A `<p>` tag for their specific role (e.g., Chief Strategic Officer).
   * A link button (`<a>`) to view their professional profile.
3. **Establish Component Boundaries:** Open `style.css`. Target `.profile-card` and give it a strict background color, a subtle border or box-shadow, and inner spacing using `padding` (e.g., `20px`). Use `border-radius: 8px;` to give the corners a modern, rounded feel.
4. **Enforce Visual Hierarchy:** Style the text inside the card. Make the member's name bold and distinct. Make the role text smaller and lighter in color so the user's eye naturally naturally goes to the name first.
5. **Duplicate to Test Stability:** Copy your single `.profile-card` HTML block and paste it 2 more times inside your container, changing just the names. If your CSS is built properly, all three cards should look perfectly uniform.

## 🚀 Bonus Challenge (Optional)
Add a smooth card hover effect! Use the transition property on your `.profile-card` class, and then use the `:hover` pseudo-class to apply `transform: translateY(-5px);` and darken the box-shadow. This makes the card look like it physically lifts up off the page when hovered over.

## ⚠️ Common Pitfalls & Expected Bugs
* **Text Leaking (Overflow):** If your profile images or long text lines are breaking outside the rounded corners of your card, add `overflow: hidden;` to your `.profile-card` class.
* **Hardcoded Widths:** Avoid setting strict pixel widths like `width: 300px;` on every single card. Instead, use percentages or let the card scale naturally within its parent container. Hardcoded widths will break responsiveness later!

## 🧠 Outcomes & Learnings
* Shifted from thinking in "pages" to thinking in modular, reusable "components."
* Mastered the implementation of visual hierarchy through font sizes and color weights.
* Understood how inner spacing (padding) defines the stability of a UI component.

>
> Today, the focus shifted toward modular engineering: Component-Driven Design. Instead of building unique, one-off layouts, I focused on creating a reusable, standardized "Profile Card" component for our core community leadership structure.
>
> By mastering inner spacing (padding) and establishing a strict visual hierarchy using typography weights, the layout remains completely stable no matter how many times the component is duplicated.

> Good software architecture is modular, and good UI architecture is no different. 🧩
