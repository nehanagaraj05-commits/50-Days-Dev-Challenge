# 🗓️ Day 21: Performance Engineering (Debouncing & Closures)

## 🎯 Problem Statement
Think back to the Real-Time Search feature we built on Day 15. We attached an event listener that fired a filtering function on *every single keystroke*. Right now, filtering a local array of 3 items is fast. But next week, we will connect this platform to external databases. If a user types "JavaScript" quickly, our current code will send 10 separate requests to the server in less than a second. This will throttle our network and potentially crash the database. 

Today, we engineer a **Debounce** utility. This forces the browser to wait until the user *stops typing* for a brief moment before executing the heavy search logic.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Focus Areas
* **Languages:** Vanilla JavaScript
* **Core Concepts:** Higher-Order Functions, Closures, `setTimeout()`, `clearTimeout()`, Network Optimization.
* **Goal:** Control the execution frequency of heavy functions to prevent performance bottlenecks.

## 📝 Task Requirements
1. **The Utility Skeleton:** Open `script.js`. We need to write a utility function called `debounce()`. This is a *Higher-Order Function*—it takes a function as an argument and returns a new, optimized version of that function.
2. **The Closure:** Inside `debounce`, define a variable `let timeout;`. Then, return an anonymous function `return function(...args) { }`. Because of a JS concept called a *closure*, this inner function will remember the `timeout` variable even after `debounce` finishes running.
3. **The Timer Logic:** Inside that returned function:
   * First, clear the existing timer using `clearTimeout(timeout);`.
   * Second, set a new timer: `timeout = setTimeout(() => { func.apply(this, args); }, delay);`. 
   * *Logic translation:* "Every time this is called, cancel the previous countdown and start a new 300ms countdown. If the countdown reaches zero without being cancelled, run the heavy function."
4. **Refactor the Search:** Take your search logic from Day 15. Wrap your search execution code in your new `debounce` function, setting a delay of `300` milliseconds.
5. **Attach the Optimized Function:** Attach your newly debounced function to the search input's `'input'` event listener. Watch your console—it will no longer fire on every keystroke!

## 🚀 Bonus Challenge (Optional)
Look up **Throttling**. While Debouncing waits for a user to *stop* an action, Throttling ensures a function runs *at most once* every X milliseconds, even if the user is continuously acting. Write a `throttle` utility function and attach it to a `window.addEventListener('scroll')` event to log the user's scroll position without crashing the browser!

## ⚠️ Common Pitfalls & Expected Bugs
* **Invoking Immediately:** A classic mistake is writing `input.addEventListener('input', debounce(searchLogic(), 300))`. Adding the `()` executes the logic immediately instead of passing the function reference. Write `debounce(searchLogic, 300)` instead!
* **Losing the `this` Context:** If you use regular functions instead of arrow functions inside your debounce timer, the `this` keyword will point to the `window` instead of your input element. Using `func.apply(this, args)` safely passes the context through.

## 🧠 Outcomes & Learnings
* Grasped the advanced concept of Lexical Scoping and Closures in JavaScript.
* Engineered an industry-standard performance utility from pure logic.
* Prepared the platform architecture to handle asynchronous API networks safely.
