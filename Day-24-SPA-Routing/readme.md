# 🗓️ Day 24: Single Page Application (SPA) Architecture & Routing

## 🎯 Problem Statement
Clicking a link on a traditional website causes the browser to flash white, download a new HTML file, and reload the entire page. It feels clunky. Modern platforms (like Spotify, Twitter, or web apps built in React) use **Single Page Application (SPA)** architecture. The page never actually reloads; the JavaScript engine simply swaps out the UI components instantly while updating the URL. Today, we build a Vanilla JS Router from scratch to achieve this premium app-like experience.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Focus Areas
* **Languages:** Vanilla JavaScript
* **Core Concepts:** The History API (`pushState`), The `popstate` event, Event Delegation (intercepting links), Dynamic View Rendering.
* **Goal:** Engineer a client-side router that intercepts navigation, updates the URL, and injects the correct UI state without ever pinging the server for a new HTML file.

## 📝 Task Requirements
1. **The HTML Shell:** Open `index.html`. Strip out all the content inside your `<main>` tag and leave it completely empty, but give it an ID: `<main id="app-root"></main>`. This is our empty canvas where the router will inject content.
2. **Intercept the Links:** Open `script.js`. Use event delegation on the `document` to listen for clicks. If a user clicks an `<a>` tag with a specific class (e.g., `.nav-link`), call `e.preventDefault()` to stop the browser from reloading the page!
3. **Update the URL:** Inside that intercept, extract the `href` attribute from the clicked link. Use `window.history.pushState({}, "", href)` to silently change the URL in the browser's address bar without triggering a reload.
4. **The Router Function:** Create an `async function router() { }`. Inside it, check the current URL using `window.location.pathname`. 
5. **The View Definitions:** Create a JavaScript object or `switch` statement that maps paths to HTML strings. (e.g., if the path is `/`, return the Hero HTML. If the path is `/team`, return the Team Cards HTML).
6. **Inject the View:** Grab your `#app-root` element and set its `innerHTML` to the HTML string that matches the current route.
7. **Handle the Back Button:** If the user clicks the browser's back button, `pushState` won't trigger. You must listen for the `window.addEventListener('popstate', router)` event to force the UI to re-render when the user navigates history!

## 🚀 Bonus Challenge (Optional)
A robust router needs a safety net. Add a "404 Not Found" route! If `window.location.pathname` doesn't match any of your defined routes (e.g., the user types `/random-page` into the URL bar), inject a custom 404 HTML view with a button that routes them back to the `/` home page.

## ⚠️ Common Pitfalls & Expected Bugs
* **Live Server Issues:** If you are using VS Code Live Server and you manually type `localhost:5500/team` and hit enter, you will get a hard 404 error from the server. Client-side routing only works if you load the root `/` first and click links to navigate. (Production servers use a redirect rule to fix this, but don't worry about that locally for now!).
* **Event Listener Wipeout:** When you use `innerHTML` to swap out pages, any event listeners attached to the old elements are destroyed. If your page has buttons, you must re-attach their listeners *after* the router injects the new HTML, or rely on global Event Delegation (like we learned on Day 19).

## 🧠 Outcomes & Learnings
* Demystified how modern JavaScript frameworks (like React Router or Vue Router) work under the hood.
* Engineered a seamless, zero-refresh navigation experience.
* Mastered the relationship between the DOM, the browser's URL history, and UI state.

> Today we built a Single Page Application (SPA) architecture completely from scratch. ⚡
>
> You don't always need React to build a fast, app-like web experience. By utilizing Vanilla JS, the native `window.history.pushState` API, and event delegation, I engineered a client-side router. It intercepts navigation, updates the URL silently, and injects dynamic views directly into the DOM—resulting in zero page reloads.
