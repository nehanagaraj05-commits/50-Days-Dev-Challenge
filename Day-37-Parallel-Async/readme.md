# 🗓️ Day 37: Parallel Network Architecture (Promise.all)

## 🎯 Problem Statement
A comprehensive dashboard needs multiple pieces of data to render fully. If you use the `await` keyword on five separate fetch requests in a row, the browser pauses execution at each line until the server responds. This is the "Waterfall Problem"—Request 2 cannot start until Request 1 finishes. Today, we optimize our architecture by dispatching all network requests simultaneously using `Promise.all`, allowing them to race across the network in parallel.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Focus Areas
* **Languages:** Vanilla JavaScript (ES8+)
* **Core Concepts:** The Waterfall Problem, `Promise.all`, `Promise.allSettled`, Array Destructuring, Parallel Execution.
* **Goal:** Merge multiple distinct API endpoints into a single, high-performance data fetching function.

## 📝 Task Requirements
1. **The Sequential Trap:** Open `api.js`. Create a new async function called `fetchDashboardData(username)`. 
2. **Setup the Fetches (Without Awaiting):** Inside the function, prepare three separate fetch requests (e.g., Profile, Repositories, and Followers). Do **not** put `await` in front of them yet! We want to create the Promises, not pause for them.
   * `const profilePromise = fetchWithRetry(url1);`
   * `const reposPromise = fetchWithRetry(url2);`
   * `const followersPromise = fetchWithRetry(url3);`
3. **The Parallel Execution:** Use `Promise.all()` and pass in an array of your promises. Now, `await` the single master Promise:
   `const responses = await Promise.all([profilePromise, reposPromise, followersPromise]);`
4. **Parse the Data:** Loop through the responses and call `.json()` on them. (Hint: `response.json()` also returns a promise, so you can use `Promise.all` on the parsing step too!)
5. **Array Destructuring:** Extract the data cleanly using ES6 array destructuring:
   `const [profile, repos, followers] = parsedData;`
6. **Return the Unified Payload:** Return a single master object containing all three pieces of data so the UI can render the entire dashboard at once.

## 🚀 Bonus Challenge (Optional)
If one single request inside `Promise.all` fails (e.g., the followers API goes down), the *entire* block throws an error and rejects. In a dashboard, if the followers fail, you still want to show the profile! Refactor your code to use `Promise.allSettled()` instead. This waits for everything to finish, regardless of success or failure, allowing you to gracefully handle partial data loads.

## ⚠️ Common Pitfalls & Expected Bugs
* **Awaiting the JSON:** Just like `fetch()` takes time, parsing JSON takes time. Beginners often write `const data = responses.map(res => await res.json())` which won't work properly inside a synchronous map function. You must use `Promise.all(responses.map(res => res.json()))`.
* **Index Mismatches:** `Promise.all` returns the data in the *exact same order* as the array of promises you fed into it, regardless of which one finished downloading first. Ensure your destructuring variables line up perfectly with your input array!

## 🧠 Outcomes & Learnings
* Eliminated the "Waterfall Problem" from the network architecture.
* Mastered advanced ES6 syntax (Array Destructuring and Promise combinators).
* Engineered a centralized data payload suitable for complex dashboard UI injection.
