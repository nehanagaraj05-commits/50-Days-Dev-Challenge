# 🗓️ Day 26: Asynchronous JavaScript & External APIs

## 🎯 Problem Statement
A static platform is predictable, but a live platform is powerful. To build tools that scale, we need to extract data from external databases and third-party servers. Today, we are building a "Community Contributor Lookup" feature. Instead of hardcoding team members, we will use the public GitHub API to fetch real-time developer profiles. We must engineer our JavaScript to request this data, wait patiently for the server to respond, and gracefully handle any network failures.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Focus Areas
* **Languages:** Vanilla JavaScript (ES8+)
* **Core Concepts:** The Event Loop (Microtask Queue), `Promises`, `async / await`, The `fetch()` API, `try / catch` Error Handling.
* **Goal:** Successfully request data from an external REST API, parse the JSON payload, and inject it into the DOM without freezing the browser.

## 📝 Task Requirements
1. **The Search UI:** Open your `index.html`. Create a new section with an `<input type="text" id="github-username" placeholder="Enter GitHub username">`, a `<button id="search-dev-btn">Lookup</button>`, and an empty `<div id="dev-profile-card"></div>`.
2. **The Async Function:** Open `script.js`. Create a new function, but put the word `async` in front of it: `async function getDeveloperProfile(username) { }`. This tells the JavaScript engine that this function will perform operations that take an unknown amount of time.
3. **Try / Catch Block:** Inside your function, wrap your logic in a `try { ... } catch (error) { ... }` block. When dealing with networks, things *will* fail (dropped connections, bad usernames). We must catch these errors so our app doesn't crash.
4. **The Fetch Call:** Inside the `try` block, declare a variable and use the fetch API: `const response = await fetch(\`https://api.github.com/users/\${username}\`);`. The `await` keyword pauses the function until the server replies, freeing up the browser to do other things in the meantime.
5. **Parse the Payload:** The server replies with raw data streams. We must parse it into a JavaScript object: `const data = await response.json();`.
6. **Error Gatekeeping:** If the user types a username that doesn't exist, GitHub returns a `404` status. Write an `if (!response.ok)` statement to throw a custom error before trying to render the data.
7. **Render the Data:** Take `data.avatar_url`, `data.name`, and `data.bio`, and inject them into your `#dev-profile-card` using template literals!

## 🚀 Bonus Challenge (Optional)
Add a "Loading..." state! Network requests take time. Right before your `fetch` call, inject a spinning CSS loader or a simple "Fetching data..." text into your profile card. Once the `await` finishes, overwrite the loading text with the actual profile data.

## ⚠️ Common Pitfalls & Expected Bugs
* **Forgetting `await`:** If you write `const data = response.json();` without `await`, JavaScript won't wait for the parsing to finish. `data` will equal a "Promise" object instead of the actual data, and your DOM will inject `[object Promise]` on the screen.
* **Network vs. 404 Errors:** A `fetch()` call only completely fails (and jumps to the `catch` block) if the internet drops or the server is completely dead. If the server responds with "404 Not Found", `fetch` considers that a *successful* connection. You must manually check `response.ok` to handle bad data!

## 🧠 Outcomes & Learnings
* Shifted from synchronous execution (line-by-line) to asynchronous execution (time-independent).
* Mastered the modern `async/await` syntax, abandoning outdated `.then()` chaining.
* Engineered a resilient network request pipeline using `try/catch`.
