# 🗓️ Day 36: Deep Linking & URL Search Parameters

## 🎯 Problem Statement
A web application is meant to be shared. If a user filters a massive dataset or searches for a specific profile, they expect to be able to copy the URL and send it to a friend. Currently, our Single Page Application (SPA) traps all state inside JavaScript memory. If you refresh or share the link, the state resets. Today, we bridge the gap between JS memory and the browser's address bar using **URL Search Parameters** (Query Strings).

## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Focus Areas
* **Languages:** Vanilla JavaScript (ES8+)
* **Core Concepts:** The `URLSearchParams` API, `window.location.search`, Browser History (`pushState`), State Hydration.
* **Goal:** Engineer a two-way sync where UI interactions update the URL, and the URL dictates the initial UI state on page load.

## 📝 Task Requirements
1. **Hydrate on Load (Read):** Open `main.js`. At the bottom of your file, write an initialization function. Inside it, grab the current URL parameters: `const params = new URLSearchParams(window.location.search);`.
2. **Check for State:** Use `params.get('user')` to see if a username exists in the URL (e.g., `?user=bradtraversy`). 
3. **Execute the Fetch:** If a user parameter exists, immediately pass it into your search function so the application automatically fetches and renders that profile the moment the page loads!
4. **Sync the URL (Write):** Go to the function that fires when the user types in the search box. When a successful search occurs, update the URL without reloading the page.
5. **Construct the New URL:** `const url = new URL(window.location); url.searchParams.set('user', username);`
6. **Push the State:** Push the new URL to the browser's address bar natively: `window.history.pushState({}, "", url);`.

## 🚀 Bonus Challenge (Optional)
What happens if the user clears the search input entirely? The URL shouldn't say `?user=`. Use `url.searchParams.delete('user')` to cleanly remove the parameter from the URL, and push that updated state to the browser. Keep the address bar spotless!

## ⚠️ Common Pitfalls & Expected Bugs
* **Replacing vs. Appending:** If you just use string concatenation (e.g., `window.location.href + '?user=' + name`), you might accidentally build a broken URL like `?user=brad?user=john`. Always use the `URLSearchParams` API to safely `set()` and `delete()` parameters.
* **Live Server Routing:** If you are testing this on VS Code Live Server and manually type `?user=test` into the URL and hit Enter, Live Server will handle it perfectly. But in production, you must ensure your server is configured to route all traffic to `index.html` (which we set up back in Day 24!).

## 🧠 Outcomes & Learnings
* Engineered shareable "Deep Links" for dynamic client-side states.
* Mastered the `URLSearchParams` interface for safe URL manipulation.
* Created a seamless, two-way data bind between the UI and the browser's location object.

> Now, as a user searches or filters data, the URL silently updates via the History API. If that URL is copied and opened in a new tab, the JavaScript engine "hydrates" the application state by reading the query strings and automatically fetching the correct data on load.
