# 🗓️ Day 30: Completing the Cycle (PUT & DELETE Requests)

## 🎯 Problem Statement
Over the last few days, we mastered `GET` (Read) and `POST` (Create). But data is rarely permanent. Users make typos that need fixing, and initiatives get cancelled and need removing. To build a fully functional application, we must engineer the final two pillars of the CRUD paradigm: `PUT` (Update) and `DELETE` (Destroy). Today, we will integrate these HTTP methods to give our users total control over their data payloads.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Focus Areas
* **Languages:** Vanilla JavaScript (ES8+)
* **Core Concepts:** Full CRUD Architecture, HTTP Methods (`PUT`, `DELETE`), URL Endpoint Targeting, UI State Syncing.
* **Goal:** Successfully transmit modification and destruction commands to a server and handle the subsequent UI updates.

## 📝 Task Requirements
1. **The Management UI:** Open `index.html`. Below yesterday's proposal form, create a "Manage Proposal" section. Add two buttons: `<button id="update-btn">Update Proposal</button>` and `<button id="delete-btn" class="btn-danger">Delete Proposal</button>`.
2. **The Update Engine (PUT):** Open `script.js`. Create an async function called `updateInitiative(id)`. 
   * Configure the `fetch` options with `method: 'PUT'`.
   * Include the standard `Content-type` headers.
   * Provide a stringified JSON body with updated data (e.g., adding " [UPDATED]" to the title).
   * **Crucial:** Target the specific ID in the URL: `fetch('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/' + id, {...})`.
3. **The Destruction Engine (DELETE):** Create an async function called `deleteInitiative(id)`.
   * Configure the `fetch` options with `method: 'DELETE'`.
   * You do **not** need headers or a body for a DELETE request! You are just sending a kill command to a specific URL.
4. **Bind the Events:** Attach click listeners to your new buttons. Hardcode an ID (like `1`) to pass into the functions to simulate modifying a specific database entry.
5. **Handle the Responses:** Log the server's response for the PUT request (it should return the modified object). For the DELETE request, log a success message (JSONPlaceholder returns an empty object `{}` on a successful delete).

## 🚀 Bonus Challenge (Optional)
Never delete data without asking first! In your delete event listener, use the native browser `window.confirm("Are you sure you want to delete this initiative? This action cannot be undone.")` method. Only execute the `deleteInitiative` fetch function if the user clicks "OK".

## ⚠️ Common Pitfalls & Expected Bugs
* **Wrong URL Targeting:** If you send a PUT request to the base `/posts` endpoint instead of a specific `/posts/1` endpoint, the server will throw an error because it doesn't know *which* post you are trying to update.
* **PUT vs. PATCH:** `PUT` replaces the *entire* object. If you only send a new title, the server might wipe out the description! If you only want to update one specific field without touching the rest, you should technically use the `PATCH` method.

## 🧠 Outcomes & Learnings
* Mastered the complete CRUD data lifecycle using native Web APIs.
* Understood how RESTful URL endpoints map to specific database entries.
* Applied defensive UX patterns to prevent accidental data loss.
