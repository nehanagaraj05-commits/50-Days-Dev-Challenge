# 🗓️ Day 14: Dynamic DOM Rendering (Data vs. View)

## 🎯 Problem Statement
Look at your Day 5 Initiatives Gallery. You hardcoded the HTML for every single project card. If the Synexus community launches 50 new initiatives next year, will you manually copy and paste that HTML 50 times? No. That is unscalable and error-prone. Today, we learn the core mechanic of dynamic platforms: storing data in JavaScript (Arrays & Objects) and using loops to automatically generate and inject the HTML. 

## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Focus Areas
* **Languages:** Vanilla JavaScript
* **Core Concepts:** Arrays & Objects, Iteration (`forEach` loop), Template Literals (`` ` ``), DOM Injection (`innerHTML`).
* **Goal:** Separate the raw data from the visual layout, writing a script that dynamically builds the UI based on whatever data it receives.

## 📝 Task Requirements
1. **Clear the Static HTML:** Open your `index.html`. Find your `.initiatives-grid` container. Delete all the hardcoded `<div class="initiative-card">` elements inside it. Leave the parent grid container completely empty, but give it an ID (e.g., `id="dynamic-grid"`).
2. **Setup the Data:** Open `script.js`. Use the provided starter code, which contains an Array of Objects representing our community projects.
3. **Select the Target:** Use `document.getElementById` to select your empty grid container and store it in a variable.
4. **Iterate & Build:** Call the `.forEach()` method on your `projectsData` array. For each project in the array, you need to construct an HTML string.
5. **Template Literals:** Inside your loop, use template literals (the backtick keys: `` ` ``) to write your HTML structure. Use the `${}` syntax to inject the specific project's `title`, `description`, and `status` directly into the HTML string.
6. **Inject into the DOM:** Use the `+=` operator on your grid container's `innerHTML` property to append your newly constructed card string into the DOM.

## 🚀 Bonus Challenge (Optional)
Introduce conditional rendering! In your loop, check the `status` of the project. If the status is "Active", add a CSS class to the card that gives it a green border. If it's "Completed", give it a gray border. 

## ⚠️ Common Pitfalls & Expected Bugs
* **The Overwrite Bug:** If you use `=` instead of `+=` when setting `innerHTML`, your loop will overwrite the container every time it runs, and you will only see the very last card on the screen!
* **Backticks vs. Quotes:** Template literals only work with backticks (`` ` ``), usually located under the ESC key on your keyboard. If you use single or double quotes, the `${}` variables will not evaluate.

## 🧠 Outcomes & Learnings
* Internalized the concept of Data-Driven UI architecture.
* Mastered the syntax of Arrays, Objects, and the `forEach` array method.
* Eliminated redundant HTML by utilizing powerful Template Literals.
