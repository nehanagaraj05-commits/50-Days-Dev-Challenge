# 🗓️ Day 20: Stateful UI Architecture & CRUD Logic (Task Tracker)

## 🎯 Problem Statement
A technical organization thrives on execution. To help community members manage their daily milestones within the challenge, we need a dedicated "Task Tracker" or "Roadmap Progress" dashboard component. Up until now, you have rendered static data or handled separate inputs. Today, we tie everything together to build a **Stateful Application Module**. You will learn how to add, toggle, and delete data objects directly within an array state and have the UI re-render flawlessly to mirror those changes.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Focus Areas
* **Languages:** Vanilla JavaScript
* **Core Concepts:** State Management, Data Mutation vs. Immutable Operations, Dynamic Array Injections (`.push()`, `.filter()`), Event Binding.
* **Goal:** Master state-driven architecture where memory states explicitly dictate what displays on the screen.

## 📝 Task Requirements
1. **The Task UI (HTML):** In your `index.html`, add a section wrapper for your tracker. It needs an `<input type="text" id="task-input">`, an `<button id="add-task-btn">Add Task</button>`, and an empty container `<ul id="task-list"></ul>`.
2. **Define the State:** Open `script.js`. Create an array called `let taskState = [];`. This array will hold objects representing each task, structured with an `id`, a string `text`, and a boolean `completed` state.
3. **The Creation Engine (Create):** Attach a click listener to your `#add-task-btn`. When clicked, grab the input value, construct a new task object (e.g., `{ id: Date.now(), text: value, completed: false }`), and push it into your `taskState` array.
4. **The Render Machine (Read):** Write a master `renderTasks()` function. Clear out your `#task-list` container, loop through your `taskState` array, and inject an HTML `<li>` for each item. Include a checkbox and a delete button (`<button class="delete-btn" data-id="${task.id}">&times;</button>`).
5. **The Event Delegation Intercept (Update/Delete):** Do not attach event listeners to every task list item. Attach a single click listener to your parent `#task-list` element.
   * **If** a checkbox is clicked, find the matching task object in your `taskState` array using its unique ID and toggle its `completed` boolean.
   * **If** a `.delete-btn` is clicked, look at its `data-id`. Filter the array to remove that object: `taskState = taskState.filter(task => task.id !== targetId);`.
6. **Call and Sync:** Ensure that every time a task is added, updated, or deleted, you call `renderTasks()` right after to force the UI to sync with your database array.

## 🚀 Bonus Challenge (Optional)
Connect your state engine to the past week's discoveries! Use your LocalStorage knowledge from Day 16 to save the `taskState` array every time it mutates, and parse it back into memory when the page loads. Now your task tracker persists through refreshes!

## ⚠️ Common Pitfalls & Expected Bugs
* **Losing State Sync:** Beginners often manipulate the DOM directly (like using `element.remove()`) without removing the item from their JavaScript array. If your data array and your UI fall out of sync, your search features, counts, and saves will break. Always update the data first, then re-render!
* **ID Matching Types:** `Date.now()` or custom IDs generate numbers. When you pull data attributes using `getAttribute()`, the browser returns a *string*. Comparing them using `===` will fail because `12345 !== "12345"`. Use `parseInt()` or `Number()` to normalize your IDs before filtering!

## 🧠 Outcomes & Learnings
* Architected a complete client-side data pipeline (Create, Read, Update, Delete).
* Understood why modern frameworks like React enforce "state-driven rendering."
* Built an interactive dashboard utility completely from scratch.

> I engineered a highly interactive, responsive Task Tracker dashboard from the ground up. The massive takeaway today was breaking the habit of changing the DOM directly. Instead, I learned how to build a unified system memory state (`taskState`), manipulate the internal array structures safely via object mapping and filtering algorithms, and have the browser automatically sync the visual interface with our memory profile.
